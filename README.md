# Eat_Green_App

This iOS iphone app gives students the ability to look up a cafeteria
food item and to then get a letter grade reflecting the environmental
impact of the food. I used information about the top carbon producing
foods and compared them to the ingredients of the food
inputted by the user. To use, just type in the food name in the search
bar and hit the button corresponding to what meal the food is in. The
program will then direct the user to the other page to recieve the grade.
Also, on the home page, there is a button that will redirect the user to
the menu called “Today’s Menu”

This app data scrapes the Harvard University dining service website and 
uses multiple threads for each GUI. 

The website I’m gathering information from is non-
secure, so you have to change security settings on whatever IDE you 
are using. This is how to do that in Xcode: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31254725/transport-security-has-blocked-a-cleartext-http
